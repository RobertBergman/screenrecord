# Introduction to Fourier Analysis

From Calculus to Frequency Domains

<!-- Script:
Welcome to our presentation on Fourier Analysis. Today, we'll explore how this powerful mathematical technique allows us to break down complex signals into simple waves. If you're comfortable with calculus, you already have the foundation needed to understand this fascinating field.

## What is Fourier Analysis?

The mathematical technique that allows us to:

* Decompose complex signals into simple sine and cosine waves
* Transform between time/space domain and frequency domain
* Reveal hidden periodic patterns in data

<!-- Script:
Fourier analysis, at its core, is about finding patterns in complex data. Just as you might break down a musical chord into individual notes, Fourier analysis breaks down complex signals into simpler components. This allows us to transform how we view data - shifting from how a signal changes over time to understanding which frequencies make up that signal.

## The Fundamental Insight

Any periodic function can be represented as a sum of sines and cosines of different frequencies.

<!-- Script:
Joseph Fourier's revolutionary insight was that any periodic function - no matter how complex - can be expressed as an infinite sum of sine and cosine functions with different frequencies. Think of it like discovering that any color can be created by mixing red, green, and blue light in different proportions. It gives us a universal language for describing signals.

## From Calculus to Fourier

The tools you already know:

* Integrals
* Derivatives 
* Periodic functions
* Trigonometric identities

<!-- Script:
The good news is that if you're familiar with calculus, you already understand most of the mathematical machinery needed for Fourier analysis. The key tools are integration, which we'll use to extract frequency components, and our understanding of trigonometric functions, which form the building blocks of Fourier analysis.

## The Fourier Series

For a periodic function f(x) with period 2π:

```
f(x) = a₀/2 + Σ[aₙcos(nx) + bₙsin(nx)]
```

Where:
```
aₙ = (1/π)∫f(x)cos(nx)dx  from -π to π
bₙ = (1/π)∫f(x)sin(nx)dx  from -π to π
```

<!-- Script:
Here's the mathematical heart of Fourier series. For any periodic function with period 2π, we can express it as a sum of scaled cosine and sine terms. The coefficients aₙ and bₙ tell us how much of each frequency component is present in our original function. These coefficients are found using integrals that might look familiar from calculus - they're essentially measuring how similar our function is to each sine or cosine component.
-->

## Example: Square Wave

A square wave jumps between +1 and -1 values.

Its Fourier series:

```
f(x) = (4/π)[sin(x) + (1/3)sin(3x) + (1/5)sin(5x) + ...]
```

<!-- Script:
Let's consider a concrete example: a square wave that alternates between +1 and -1. The Fourier series for this function shows something remarkable - it's composed of only sine terms, and only odd frequencies at that. Each term gets smaller as the frequency increases. If we add up just the first few terms, we start to see a shape that approximates our square wave, with more terms giving us a better approximation.

# Visualizing Fourier Series

* Adding more terms improves the approximation
* "Gibbs phenomenon" explains the overshoot near discontinuities

<!-- Script:
This visualization shows how adding more terms to our Fourier series gradually builds up a better approximation of the square wave. With just one term - the fundamental frequency - we get a simple sine wave. As we add more terms, we see the approximation getting closer to the target square wave. Notice the interesting overshoot near the sharp transitions - this is called the Gibbs phenomenon, and it's a fundamental limitation of Fourier series when approximating discontinuous functions.

## The Fourier Transform

Extends the idea to non-periodic functions:

```
F(ω) = ∫f(t)e^(-iωt)dt  from -∞ to ∞
```

And the inverse:

```
f(t) = (1/2π)∫F(ω)e^(iωt)dω  from -∞ to ∞
```

<!-- Script:
The Fourier series works for periodic functions, but what about signals that don't repeat? That's where the Fourier transform comes in. It extends the same idea to non-periodic functions by using complex exponentials and integrating over all time. The result, F(ω), tells us how much of each frequency component ω is present in our signal f(t). The inverse transform lets us reconstruct our original signal from its frequency components.
-->

## Euler's Formula: The Bridge

```
e^(ix) = cos(x) + i·sin(x)
```

This connects exponential and trigonometric functions, simplifying Fourier analysis.

<!-- Script:
Euler's formula provides an elegant bridge between exponential and trigonometric functions. This remarkable equation allows us to express our sines and cosines in terms of complex exponentials, which turns out to be mathematically convenient. Don't worry if complex numbers seem intimidating - in Fourier analysis, we're mainly using them as a tool to simplify our calculations.

## Real-World Applications

* Signal processing (audio, image, video)
* Data compression (JPEG, MP3)
* Solving differential equations
* Quantum mechanics
* Medical imaging (MRI)

<!-- Script:
Fourier analysis isn't just mathematical theory - it's one of the most widely applied mathematical techniques in science and engineering. When you listen to digital music or look at a compressed image, Fourier transforms are at work. MRI machines use Fourier transforms to convert radio signals into images of your body. Even quantum mechanics relies heavily on Fourier analysis to understand wave functions.

## The Discrete Fourier Transform

For computational applications:

```
X[k] = Σx[n]e^(-i2πkn/N)  for n = 0 to N-1
```

Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) computes this efficiently.

<!-- Script:
In practice, computers can't handle continuous functions or infinite sums. Instead, we use the Discrete Fourier Transform, which works with sampled data points. The Fast Fourier Transform, or FFT, is an algorithm that computes this efficiently - reducing computation time from O(N²) to O(N log N). This algorithmic breakthrough, formalized by Cooley and Tukey in 1965, is what makes real-time Fourier analysis possible in modern applications.
-->

## Time-Frequency Tradeoff

* Better time resolution = worse frequency resolution
* Better frequency resolution = worse time resolution

This is a fundamental limitation (Uncertainty Principle).

<!-- Script:
There's an important limitation to Fourier analysis: we can't simultaneously have perfect resolution in both time and frequency domains. This is similar to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. If we want to know exactly when something happened in our signal, we sacrifice information about its frequency content. Conversely, to precisely determine frequencies, we need to observe our signal for a longer time period.
