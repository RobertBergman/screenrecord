## Speaker Notes

You can add notes only visible to you

## Adding Slide Scripts

Add narration scripts that can be read during presentation

<!-- Script:
This is a script for narration. Scripts are added using HTML comments with the 'Script:' prefix.
Scripts can be used for narration text that accompanies each slide during recording.
They appear after the slide content but before the slide separator.
