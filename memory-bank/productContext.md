- **Control**: Users should feel in control of their recording process with clear feedback

## Typical User Flow
1. User opens the application in their browser
2. User selects what to record (entire screen, application window, or browser tab)
3. User configures optional settings (webcam, audio sources, quality)
4. User starts recording with clear indication that recording is in progress
5. User interacts with their screen normally during recording
6. User stops recording when finished
7. User previews recording before downloading
8. User downloads recording in preferred format

## Key Differentiators
