# Active Context - Screen Recorder with Markdown Slides

## Current Work Focus

### Git Branch Management
We have created a dedicated 'markdown' branch for the new slide functionality:
- All markdown-related code has been committed to the 'markdown' branch
- The branch has been pushed to the remote repository
- The branch is ready for review through GitHub's pull request system

We have enhanced the Screen Recorder application by implementing a new feature that allows users to create presentations using Markdown slides. This feature is fully integrated with the existing recording capabilities, enabling users to record their slide presentations with optional webcam overlay and audio.

### Technology Upgrades
- Upgraded to React 19.0.0, leveraging the latest React features and performance improvements
- Updated TypeScript to version 5.7.2 with enhanced type checking
- Implemented latest ESLint 9.22.0 with modern rule configurations
- Added React Markdown 10.1.0 for enhanced markdown rendering capabilities
- Integrated marked 15.0.11 and PrismJS 1.30.0 for markdown processing and syntax highlighting

### New Features Added

1. **Markdown Slides Feature**
   - Users can create and edit presentation slides using Markdown syntax
   - Support for slide layouts, formatting, and speaker notes
   - Live preview of slides as they're being edited
   - Full-screen presentation mode with navigation controls
   - Seamless integration with screen recording features
   - Text-to-speech narration for slides with script support
   - Auto-play presentation mode with TTS and automatic slide advancement

2. **Text-to-Speech Narration**
   - Added script support for slide narration using markdown comments
   - Integrated OpenAI TTS API for high-quality speech synthesis
   - Implemented Web Speech API fallback for browsers without API key
   - Created settings panel for API key configuration and TTS options
   - Added playback controls in presentation mode with visual indicators
   - Implemented keyboard shortcuts for controlling TTS playback

### Recent Changes

#### Styling and Component Improvements
- Fixed styled-components warnings by implementing transient props
  - Converted regular props to transient props using `$` prefix in styled components
  - Updated RecordingControls component to use proper props handling
  - Improved TypeScript type checking for styled components
  - Fixed timer-related type issues with proper window reference and type casting

#### New Components
- **SlideRenderer**: Renders individual markdown slides with proper formatting and layouts

- **SlideModule**: Integrates all slide components into a cohesive user interface with settings access
- **SettingsModal**: Provides configuration interface for TTS API keys and options
- **FileImportHandler**: New component for importing external markdown presentation files

#### Recent Fixes
- Fixed TypeScript build errors by removing unused imports and variables
  - Removed unused imports like `HAS_SYSTEM_AUDIO_SUPPORT`, `recordingService`, `QUALITY_PRESETS`, `SlideTheme`, and `Slide`
  - Fixed unused variable declarations in components (removed unused `state` variable, fixed stream destructuring)
  - Commented out unused functions like `handleCreateSlides` and `handleFileSelect`
  - These changes improved code quality and maintainability while fixing TypeScript's strict checking errors
- Fixed issue where slide editor would disappear when hitting escape after presentation mode
  - Updated slideReducer to properly restore editor mode when exiting presentation mode
- Added ability to open exported presentations
  - Added "Open File" button in the slide module header
  - Implemented file import modal with drag-and-drop support
  - Added markdown file reading and importing capabilities
- Improved onscreen controls in presentation mode
  - Made controls larger, more visible, and more interactive
  - Added subtle animations and hover effects for better user feedback
  - Improved visual hierarchy with better spacing and borders
  - Enhanced speaker notes visibility with better styling
  - Improved help popup readability with better typography and colors
  - Added visual indicators for active states (speaking/auto-play)

#### New Services
- **MarkdownParserService**: Converts markdown content to slide objects and vice versa, including script extraction
- **TTSService**: Provides text-to-speech functionality using OpenAI API with Web Speech API fallback

#### State Management
- Added SlideContext for managing slide state throughout the application
- Implemented SlideReducer for handling slide state changes
- Extended AppContext to support navigation to the slides feature
- Added script and TTS state management in SlideContext
- Implemented auto-play mode with sequential slide advancement

#### UI Changes
- Updated MediaSourceSelector to provide an option for creating slides
- Implemented card-based UI for selecting between screen recording and slides
- Added navigation between slide editing and presentation modes

## Implementation Best Practices

### React Implementation
- Using functional components with hooks throughout the application
- Applying proper memoization using `useMemo` and `useCallback` to optimize rendering
- Following rules of hooks - only calling at top level, not in conditionals
- Avoiding component creation inside render functions
- Implementing proper cleanup in useEffect hooks to prevent memory leaks
- Using component composition instead of inheritance for reusable UI elements
- Using transient props (`$` prefix) with styled-components to prevent DOM attribute warnings

### TypeScript Implementation
- Using explicit return types for all functions
- Ensuring proper null/undefined checks for optional properties
- Using correct module import/export patterns
- Leveraging TypeScript's discriminated unions for complex state management
- Avoiding the 'any' type in favor of proper type definitions
- Using interfaces for object shapes and types for unions/primitives
- Properly typing timer IDs and event handlers

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Steps
- Improve template loading mechanism to more reliably load from public/assets
- Enhance slide templates with more layout options and examples
- Add export functionality for slides (PDF, PPTX)
- Improve integration with recording controls to better support recording slide presentations
- Add theme support for slide customization
- Add more voice options and language support for TTS narration
- Implement transcript generation from recordings

### Performance Optimization
- Implement Web Workers for processing recording chunks off the main thread
- Optimize rendering of markdown content for complex slide layouts
- Add lazy loading for non-critical components
- Improve memory management for long recordings and large slide decks

### Enhanced Features
- Add collaborative editing capabilities for slides
- Implement drag-and-drop slide organization
- Create additional slide transition effects
- Add support for embedding videos and interactive elements in slides
- Implement cloud storage integration for recordings and presentations
