# Active Context - Screen Recorder with Markdown Slides

## Current Work Focus

### Git Branch Management
We have created a dedicated 'markdown' branch for the new slide functionality:
- All markdown-related code has been committed to the 'markdown' branch
- The branch has been pushed to the remote repository
- The branch is ready for review through GitHub's pull request system

We have enhanced the Screen Recorder application by implementing a new feature that allows users to create presentations using Markdown slides. This feature is fully integrated with the existing recording capabilities, enabling users to record their slide presentations with optional webcam overlay and audio.

### New Features Added

   - Users can create and edit presentation slides using Markdown syntax
   - Support for slide layouts, formatting, and speaker notes
   - Live preview of slides as they're being edited
