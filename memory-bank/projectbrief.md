# Screen Recorder - Project Brief

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a web-based screen recording application built with React and TypeScript that allows users to capture their screen with optional webcam overlay and audio inputs.

## Core Objectives
- Create a user-friendly screen recording application
- Provide flexible recording options (screen, webcam, audio)
- Ensure high-quality recording capabilities
- Deliver a responsive and accessible user interface
- Maintain local-first architecture for privacy and performance

## Key Features
1. **Screen Capture Options**
   - Entire screen recording
   - Application window recording
   - Browser tab recording

2. **Input Source Management**
   - Webcam integration with configurable overlay
   - Microphone audio capture
   - System audio capture
   - Simultaneous multi-source recording

3. **Recording Controls**
   - Start/Stop/Pause/Resume functionality
   - Recording timer and status indicators
   - Error handling and recovery

4. **Output Configuration**
   - Multiple format support (WebM, MP4)
   - Quality settings (resolution, frame rate, bitrate)
   - Local storage of recordings
   - Download capabilities

## Success Criteria
- Users can successfully record their screen with minimal setup
- Application works across modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Interface is intuitive with minimal learning curve
- Recordings maintain high quality with efficient file sizes
- Application follows security best practices for media capture

## Constraints
