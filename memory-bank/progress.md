## Decisions & Learnings

### Key Decisions
- Using React with TypeScript for type safety and maintainability
- Adopting a component-based architecture with separation of concerns
- Using browser Media APIs directly with appropriate abstractions
- Following a local-first approach for privacy and performance
- Implementing a phased approach to feature development
- Using functional components with hooks exclusively
- Adopting latest React patterns and best practices
- Using transient props with styled-components to prevent DOM attribute warnings

### Lessons Learned
- Styled-components require transient props (with `$` prefix) to prevent warnings when passing custom props
- MediaRecorder's stop event needs careful handling to ensure all chunks are processed
- Object URL lifecycle management is critical for proper media handling
- Video element playback requires handling of AbortError during rapid state changes
- Proper cleanup of resources is essential to prevent memory leaks
- Asynchronous media operations require robust error handling
- State management for complex UI components benefits from reducer pattern
- Explicit TypeScript typing improves code reliability and developer experience
- Proper memoization significantly improves rendering performance

## Open Questions

- How to best combine multiple media streams (screen + webcam) efficiently?
- What's the optimal approach for handling system audio across different browsers?
- How to ensure efficient memory usage for longer recordings?
- What's the best error recovery strategy for permission denials?
- How to structure the state management for optimal performance and maintainability?
- How to handle codec selection for better cross-browser compatibility?
- What's the best approach for handling very large recording files?
- How to implement optimal slide transition effects?
- What's the most effective way to implement collaborative editing?

## Resource Utilization

### Performance Metrics
- Initial load time: Under 2 seconds on average connections
- Memory usage during recording: 150-250MB depending on quality settings
- CPU usage during recording: 15-30% depending on resolution and webcam usage
- Storage requirements: Approximately 5MB per minute of recording at medium quality
