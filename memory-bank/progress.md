# Screen Recorder - Progress Tracking

## Project Status: Early Development

The Screen Recorder project has moved from initial setup to early development. The basic architecture is implemented, and we're now fixing bugs and improving core functionality.

## What Works

- âœ… Project vision and requirements established
- âœ… Architecture and system design documented
- âœ… Technical approach determined
- âœ… Memory bank initialized with core documentation
- âœ… Basic project structure with React and TypeScript
- âœ… Core UI components implemented
- âœ… Screen capture functionality
- âœ… Recording controls (start, pause, resume, stop)
- âœ… Basic media playback and download
- âœ… Enhanced homepage with visually appealing design
- âœ… Real screen recording demo on homepage
- âœ… Direct screen capture from homepage buttons
- âœ… Markdown slide creation and editing functionality
- âœ… Slide presentation mode with navigation controls
- âœ… Integration of slides with screen recording

## What's In Progress

- ðŸ”„ Error handling improvements
- ðŸ”„ Media stream management optimizations
- ðŸ”„ Cross-browser compatibility testing
- ðŸ”„ Performance optimizations for longer recordings

## What's Next

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Initialize React + TypeScript project with Vite
2. Set up basic project structure following the defined architecture
3. Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality
4. Create basic UI layout and component shells
5. Implement basic media device enumeration

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Core Recording (Current Focus)
- [x] Project setup and scaffolding
- [x] Basic UI implementation 
- [x] Media device enumeration
- [x] Screen capture functionality
- [x] Basic recording controls
- [x] Local saving of recordings
- [x] Enhanced homepage with example recordings

#### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- [ ] Webcam integration and overlay
- [ ] Audio mixing capabilities (mic + system)
- [ ] Advanced recording controls (pause/resume)
- [ ] Quality settings implementation
- [ ] Recording preview functionality
- [ ] Format options (WebM, MP4)

#### Phase 3: Polish & Optimization
- [ ] UI refinements and consistency
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Cross-browser testing and compatibility
- [ ] Error handling improvements
- [ ] Accessibility enhancements
- [ ] Documentation and usage guides

## Technical Debt & Known Issues

### Fixed Issues
- âœ… Recording preview not working after stopping a recording
- âœ… Downloaded file not accessible/usable after recording

### Known Issues
- Media handling in Firefox may require different approach due to codec support differences
- Long recordings may cause performance issues
- System audio capture not supported in all browsers

## Development History

### April 29, 2025
- Created and pushed 'markdown' branch to repository
- Implemented markdown slide functionality with the following components:
  - SlideRenderer for displaying markdown slides
  - SlideEditor for creating and editing slides
  - Presentation component for full-screen presentation mode
  - SlideContent for managing content and templates
  - SlideModule for integrating all slide components
- Added MarkdownParserService for converting markdown to slide objects
- Added state management through SlideContext and SlideReducer
- Integrated slides functionality with existing screen recorder components
- Added example slides and templates

### April 27, 2025
- Initialized memory bank with core documentation
- Established project vision and requirements
- Defined system architecture and technical approach
- Created initial component structure plan
- Implemented core UI components and service layer
- Fixed critical issues with recording preview and download functionality:
  - Added proper timing in MediaRecorder stop event handling
  - Improved object URL lifecycle management
  - Enhanced media stream error handling
  - Fixed race conditions in media element playback
  - Added better error recovery mechanisms
- Enhanced homepage with improved visual design:
  - Added gradient header and modern layout
  - Integrated real screen recording example
  - Created feature highlight cards
  - Implemented direct screen capture from homepage buttons
  - Added TypeScript declarations for WebM video files

## Decisions & Learnings

### Key Decisions
- Using React with TypeScript for type safety and maintainability
- Adopting a component-based architecture with separation of concerns
- Using browser Media APIs directly with appropriate abstractions
- Following a local-first approach for privacy and performance
- Implementing a phased approach to feature development

### Lessons Learned
- MediaRecorder's stop event needs careful handling to ensure all chunks are processed
- Object URL lifecycle management is critical for proper media handling
- Video element playback requires handling of AbortError during rapid state changes
- Proper cleanup of resources is essential to prevent memory leaks
- Asynchronous media operations require robust error handling

## Open Questions

- How to best combine multiple media streams (screen + webcam) efficiently?
- What's the optimal approach for handling system audio across different browsers?
- How to ensure efficient memory usage for longer recordings?
- What's the best error recovery strategy for permission denials?
- How to structure the state management for optimal performance and maintainability?
- How to handle codec selection for better cross-browser compatibility?
- What's the best approach for handling very large recording files?

## Resource Utilization

*Will be tracked as development progresses.*
